# Computational Physics

This repository is dedicated to the **Computational Physics** course offered in the Postgraduate Program at the Physics Institute of the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia (UFU).  

## Course Overview

The course explores various approaches to applying computational physics for a deeper understanding of real-world problems. It begins with the fundamentals of **Neural Networks (NN)** and their applications in physics, including core concepts such as **Gradient Descent** and the role of the **learning rate** in function optimization. The course also introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to enhance programming skills. **Machine Learning (ML)** is presented as a practical tool for function fitting and prediction, which is highly relevant in physics. Additionally, the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)** using Python are covered. The course concludes with an exploration of **band structures**, examining the relationship between energy and wave vectors and how different parameters influence this relationship.
