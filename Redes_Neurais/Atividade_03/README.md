## Simple neural network

This activity involves building a machine learning model using polynomial functions and applying it to approximate sinusoidal functions. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function, with the 'Adam' optimizer and 'tanh' activation function. The main objective is to train the model to interpolate polynomial functions and analyze how the number of layers, neurons, and other parameters affect the results.
