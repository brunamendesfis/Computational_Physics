# 3rd Activity

## Simple neural network

The activity involves constructing a neural network (NN) using polynomial functions and applying the model to sinusoidal functions. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) was selected as the loss function, along with the 'Adam' optimizer and 'tanh' as the activation function. The main objective is to train the NN to interpolate the polynomial functions and understand how the number of layers, neurons, and other parameters can impact the result.
