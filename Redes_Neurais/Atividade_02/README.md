This activity provides an opportunity to use object-oriented programming in Python by creating a class that represents a particle in 2D. The objective is to use this class to simulate oblique motion using Newton's Second Law. The provided code simulates and plots the trajectory of a particle launched with an initial velocity under gravity. It updates the particleâ€™s position and velocity at each time step, stops when the particle hits the ground, and uses linear interpolation to find the exact landing point. The result is a plot showing the full path from launch to landing.

The result can be seen below
