# Neural Network

This folder documents my progress in learning the fundamentals of Neural Networks (NNs) and other programming methods throughout this course.

## 1st Activity:

To better understand NNs, this first activity focused on understand what a learning rate is and how to apply it to optimize a function using Gradient Descent (GD). This concept was extremely important for the next steps.

## 2nd Activity:

The second activity is the only one not specifically about NNs. Nevertheless, in this activity, I constructed a class using object-oriented programming from scratch. The main objective of this class was to represent a particle in two-dimensional space and its oblique launch.

## 3rd Activity:

Machine learning was used to fit polynomial functions to training data and then predict sinusoidal functions. This approach was quite interesting, as I was able to better understand the importance of the number of layers, neurons, and other parameters in the model.

## 4th Activity:

This last activity was the most interesting. Using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the cooling of a coffee mug, the exercise involved creating both analytical and numerical methods to compare results and to extrapolate them using neural networks. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) were applied to refine the model, as PINNs are effective for extrapolation tasks.
